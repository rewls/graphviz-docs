= Node Shapes
:imagesdir: images

* There are three main types of shapes : polygon-based, record-based and
  user-defined.

'''

* The record-based shape has largely been superseded and greatly generalized by
  HTML-like labels.
* That is, instead of using `shape=record`, one might consider using `shape=none`,
  `margin=0` and an HTML-like label.

'''

* The geometry and style of all node shapes are affected by the node attributes
  `fixedsize`, `fontname`, `fontsize`, `height`, `label`, `style` and `width`.

== Polygon-based Nodes

* The possible polygon-based shapes are displayed below.

'''

* box
+
[graphviz,target=box]
....
graph { n [shape=box,label=""] }
....

* none
+
[graphviz,target=none]
....
graph { none [shape=none] }
....

== Styles for Nodes

* The `style` attribute can be used to modify the appearance of a node.
* At present, there are 8 style values recognized: `filled`, `invisible`,
  `diagonals`, `rounded`, `dashed`, `dotted`, `solid` and `bold`.
* As usual, the value of the style attribute can be a comma-separated list of
  any of these.
* If the style contains conflicts (e.g, `style="dotted, solid"`), the last
  attribute wins.

.`rounded`
* The rounded style causes the polygonal corners to be smoothed.
* Note that this style also applies to record-based nodes.
* Indeed, the `Mrecord` shape is simply shorthand for setting this style.
* Also, prior to 26 April 2005, the rounded and filled styles were mutually
  exclusive.
+
'''
* As an example of rounding, dot uses the graph:
+
[,dot]
----
digraph R {
  rankdir=LR
  node [style=rounded]
  node1 [shape=box]
  node2 [fillcolor=yellow, style="rounded,filled", shape=diamond]
  node3 [shape=record, label="{ a | b | c }"]

  node1 -> node2 -> node3
}
----
+
====
[graphviz,rounded]
....
digraph R {
  rankdir=LR
  node [style=rounded]
  node1 [shape=box]
  node2 [fillcolor=yellow, style="rounded,filled", shape=diamond]
  node3 [shape=record, label="{ a | b | c }"]

  node1 -> node2 -> node3
}
....

== HTML-Like Labels

[NOTE]
====
* This feature is only available on versions of Graphviz that are newer than
  mid-November 2003.
* In particular, it is not part of release 1.10.
====

[NOTE]
====
* The font markups for bold, italic, underlining, subscript and superscript
  (`<B>`, `<I>`, `<U>`, `<SUB>` and `<SUP>`) are only available in versions
  after 14 October 2011, and the markup for strike-through (`<S>`) requires
  versions later than 15 September 2013.
* In addition, all of these markups are currently only available via the cairo
  and svg renderers.
* The horizontal and vertical rules (`<HR>` and `<VR>`) are only available in
  versions later than 8 July 2011.
====

[NOTE]
====
* For releases later than 9 September 2014, one can use `shape=plain` so that
  the size of the node is totally determined by the label.
* Otherwise, the node's margin, width and height values may cause the node to be
  larger, so that edges are clipped away from the label.
* In effect, `shape=plain` is shorthand for `shape=none width=0 height=0
  margin=0`.
====

* If the value of a label attribute (label for nodes, edges, clusters, and
  graphs, and the headlabel and taillabel attributes of an edge) is given as an
  HTML string, that is, delimited by `<...>` rather than `"..."`, the label is
  interpreted as an HTML description.
* At their simplest, such labels can describe multiple lines of variously
  aligned text as provided by ordinary string labels.
* More generally, the label can specify a table similar to those provided by
  HTML, with different graphical attributes at each level.

'''

* As HTML strings are processed like HTML input, any use of the `"`, `&`, `<`,
  and `>` characters in literal text or in attribute values need to be replaced
  by the corresponding escape sequence.
* For example, if you want to use & in an href value, this should be represented
  mkas &amp;.

[NOTE]
====
* The features and syntax supported by these labels are modeled on HTML.
* However, there are many aspects that are relevant to Graphviz labels that are
  not in HTML and, conversely, HTML allows various constructs which are
  meaningless in Graphviz.
* We will generally refer to these labels as "HTML labels" rather than the
  cumbersome "HTML-like labels" but the reader is warned that these are not
  really HTML.
* The grammar below describes precisely what Graphviz will accept.
====

* Although HTML labels are not, strictly speaking, a shape, they can be viewed
  as a generalization of the record shapes described above.
* In particular, if a node has set its `shape` attribute to `none` or
  `plaintext`, the HTML label will be the node's shape.
* On the other hand, if the node has any other shape (except `point`), the HTML
  label will be embedded within the node the same way an ordinary label would
  be.
* Adding HTML labels to record-based shapes (record and Mrecord) is discouraged
  and may lead to unexpected behavior because of their conflicting label schemas
  and overlapping functionality.

'''

* The following is an abstract grammar for HTML labels.
* Terminals, corresponding to elements, are shown in bold font, and nonterminals
  in italics.
* Square brackets `[` and `]` enclose optional items.
* Vertical bars `|` separate alternatives.
* Note that, as in HTML, element and attribute names are case-insensitive.
** cf. sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of the HTML 4.01 specification.

* All non-printing characters such as tabs or newlines are ignored.
* Above, a _string_ is any collection of printable characters, including spaces.

'''

* HTML comments are allowed within an HTML string.
* They can occur anywhere provided that, if they contain part of an HTML
  element, they must contain the entire element.

'''

* As is obvious from the above description, the interpretation of white space
  characters is one place where HTML-like labels is very different from standard
  HTML.
* In HTML, any sequence of white space characters is collapsed to a single
  space, If the user does not want this to happen, the input must use
  non-breaking spaces &nbsp;.
* This makes sense in HTML, where text layout depends dynamically on the space
  available.
* In Graphviz, the layout is statically determined by the input, so it is
  reasonable to treat ordinary space characters as non-breaking.
* In addition, ignoring tabs and newlines allows the input text to be formatted
  for easier reading.

'''

* Each of the HTML elements has a set of optional attributes.
* Attribute values must appear in double quotes.

=== Font specification

[source, dot]
<FONT
  COLOR="color"
  FACE="fontname"
  POINT-SIZE="value"
>

=== POINT-SIZE="value"

* sets the size of the font, in points, used within the scope of
  `<FONT>...</FONT>`.
* This can be overridden by a POINT-SIZE attribute in descendents.
* By default, the font size is determined by the fontsize attribute of the
  corresponding node, edge or graph.
